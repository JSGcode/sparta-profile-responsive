                        <p><span>Final Project: </span>Modern day industries that handle powder make use of pneumatic pipelines. The velocity at which the powder travel is an important factor and needs to be regulated. Too fast can cause damage and safety issues. Too slow may unnecessarily increase cost. The aim of the project was to help by designing an FPGA hardware-base system by implementing a cross-correlator to calculate the velocity at which the particles within a pneumatic pipeline travels at, by making use of the particles electrostatic signals.</p></li>
